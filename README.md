<h1>Problem : </h1>

From a set of ppts, recommend top 10 relevant ppts for a given query.

<h1>Solution:</h1>

The core of the model was TF-IDF and cosine similarity and other engineered features used were:
- Sector
- Country
- Technology
- Year
- Name of the ppt

Based of these features my model computed a score for each ppt and sorted the ppts based on that score for a given query.
